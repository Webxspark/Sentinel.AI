## ü§î The problem faced by the majority of us today

In critical emergencies, time is of the essence. However, when the emergency call center faces overwhelming demand or lacks sufficient staff, callers often endure long wait times before their calls are answered. This delay can have severe consequences, risking lives and property. Our hackathon project, Sentinel.AI, addresses this issue by employing artificial intelligence to assess the urgency of each call and promptly relay pertinent details to emergency handlers. This innovative solution enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency services, potentially mitigating loss of life and minimizing property damage.

## ‚úÖ How Sentinel.AI Works

When a caller contacts the handler and no handlers are available, the Sentinel.AI system seamlessly takes over. The system prompts the caller to describe the emergency, utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze the call's content. Based on the keywords and phrases used by the caller, the system assesses the call's importance and assigns it a priority level.
For urgent calls, Sentinel.AI promptly transfers the essential information to the handler. This includes the caller's location, a transcript of the call, and any other relevant details. In cases where the call is less urgent, Sentinel.AI may provide automated responses to assist the caller until an emergency handler becomes available. This ensures that callers receive immediate attention for critical situations while providing guidance and support for less pressing emergencies.
